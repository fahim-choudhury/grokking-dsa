# Grokking Data Structure and Algorithm

The repository contains solutions to various problems related to data structure and algorithm interview preparation.

## Project structure

Instead of having random problems, all the problems are categorized into coding patterns.
These patterns are arranged in separate packages. Each package will contain solutions to multiple problems.

## How to run

Each `Solution.kt` file under `src/main/kotlin/<pattern>` package contains the link of the problem at the beginning.
If there are no links, a `Problem` file will be provided.

To check the solution, you need to run the tests under the specific package.
For example, you can run the tests in the `src/test/kotlin/twoPointers/validPalindrome/SolutionTest.kt` file to check
the solution of the LeetCode
problem, [125. Valid Palindrome]( https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/).

For trying out the implementation of the data structures, you have to run `Driver.kt` file in the corresponding package.
